# TwitterDataAnalysis

Hello everyone this repository is all about tweet sentiment analysis. 
In particularly you can do sentiment analysis on any text. 

What exactly is sentiment analysis?
-> Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. 

You can read more about it more over here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis

The evaluation is based upon various metrics. I've discussed subjectivity and polarity over here:

Subjectivity:
Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgment whereas objective refers to factual information.

Polarity:
Polarity in sentiment analysis refers to identifying sentiment orientation (positive, neutral, and negative) in written or spoken language. 

In the file I've used twitter to extract user information. 

The twitter API requires 4 keys of your APP
Consumerkey, ConsumerSecret , Accesstoken, AccesstokenSecret 

To create an APP read the document https://docs.inboundnow.com/guide/create-twitter-application/

Once you have this you can follow the structure of the code to get the required.
